        <h1>History of Idaho</h1>
        <div>
            <h2 class="font"></h2>Idaho's history is a tale of exploration, settlement, and resource exploitation. Native American tribes, such as the Nez Perce and Shoshone, inhabited the land long before European contact. The region witnessed an influx of pioneers during the 19th century, drawn by the promise of fertile valleys and abundant resources. The discovery of gold in the 1860s fueled rapid growth, leading to the establishment of Idaho Territory in 1863 and statehood in 1890. Throughout its history, Idaho's economy has evolved from mining and agriculture to include industries like timber and tourism. Today, the state continues to honor its heritage while embracing modern challenges and opportunities.
